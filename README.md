 Description:

This repository contains Python code for analyzing Ethereum blockchain transactions using the Etherscan API. The code fetches transaction data for a given Ethereum address within a specified range of blocks, performs statistical analysis on the transactions, and plots graphs showing "Account Time vs Ether(ETH) Value" and "Account Time vs Gas paid (in ETH)".

 Features:

- Fetch Ethereum transactions using the Etherscan API.
- Perform statistical analysis on transaction data, including total transactions, unique addresses, total value transferred, average gas used, and average gas price.
- Plot graphs to visualize transaction data over time.
- Supports customization of Ethereum address, block range, and analysis parameters.

 Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (requests, matplotlib).
3. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your Etherscan API key in the code.
4. Run the `transactions.py` script.
5. Follow the prompts to input Ethereum address, start block, and end block.
6. View the statistical analysis and plotted graphs in the terminal and graphical interface.
